    # {frontmatter.title}

    I am an applications developer working at Bayside Church in California.
    I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Computer Science from Liberty University.

    Although computer science was my major, I was previously a mathematics major and considered going into education.
    I still find education highly important and have worked at a school previously.

    Some the things I'm interested in learning more about are:
    - Databases: I find working with databases enjoyable and want a better understanding of how they function.
    - Mathematics: I just enjoy the topic, especially because it was my initial major in college.
    - Biology: I never went past an _Intro to Bio_ course and would love to expand my knowledge here.
