    I am an applications developer working in California.
    I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Computer Science.

    Although computer science was my major, I was previously a mathematics major and considered going into education.
    This site will be a collection of my notes, projects, and other things I find interesting.

    There's a lot I'd like to learn more about. Even a degree doesn't guarantee you know everything about a topic.
    
    Hopefully this site will help me learn more about the topics I'm interested in,
    and maybe help others learn more about them as well.
