# Introduction

In college, they teach you about security and many of the important things you need to do to build a secure application.
A great resource for keeping up-to-date with security practices is to review OWASP's Top Ten.
This is a dynamic list that ranks security risks in terms of how critical they are to a web application.
One of the top ones has been broken access control, which means that permissions within the application aren't working as expected.
Within a small personal application, one might not think about having to create permissions for people, or entities; However,
as an application grows it becomes increasingly clear that access control is vital to the security of the project.
In this article, I will be discussing some forms of access control and their implementations.

# Role Based Access Control

The first form of permissions that probably comes to mind for most people is **Role Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
RBAC is exactly what it says it is: things are assigned roles and based on those roles they have certain permissions in the application.
An example of this would be the roles 'Admin', 'Staff', and 'User'. Obviously, the admin role should have the highest permissions
while the other two would be lower with user having the lowest permissions (if any).

In terms of schema, this could be provided as a property or field on a main class, such as Person.
It could also be defined in terms of groups and group roles.

```json
GroupMember {
    Id
    GroupId
    Role // Role is defined on the Group Member
    PersonId
}

Person {
    Id
    Role // Role is defined directly on the Person
}
```

This form of access control makes a lot of sense at the beginning.
Within a dynamic application you could even create many different groups to divide people into more specific permissions.
The main problem that comes with RBAC is that you have to know the groups ahead of time.
It can be pretty challenging to perform a large modification to the group permissions.
If someone is in multiple roles, then it can be difficult to just reduce them to the role that best suits them.

In an application we use at our work, they rely on RBAC for permissions.
They give a default role for un-authenticated users and the roles are checked in a top-down style when permissions are checked.
For an example, you can have a page that should only be viewed by a few groups. That would look like this:


| Group   | Allow/Deny |
|---------|------------|
| Group A | Allow      |
| Group B | Allow      |
| Group C | Allow      |
| All Users | Deny      |

If a person is within Groups A-C, they have the correct permissions; however, the rest of the users don't have those permissions.

## Implementation

In this application, the way they implement permissions is with a SQL table that stores most of the permissions
 as well as some logic within the classes. The SQL table parts are fairly easy to understand, but it becomes
 complicated when you have to reach into a class to find who its parent authority is.

Maybe the oddest thing about it that I noticed is that it stores the permissions in server cache:
```csharp
var authorizations = new Dictionary<int, Dictionary<int, Dictionary<string, List<AuthRule>>>>();
```
I don't think it's a bad thing to store the permissions in cache, except for when the permissions update and the cache needs to change.
I do think it's interesting to use a triple nested dictionary to store these though.
It allows for some fast retrieval times, but it also increases the complexity of the code.
I would love to see how other projects implement RBAC.
For instance, I'm pretty sure you could implement this same system with trees instead of dictionaries.

# Attribute Based Access Control

**Attribute Based Access Control(ABAC)** defines the permissions for a system based on attributes of the user, or environment.
In a silly example, this could mean only users with the name "Joe Schmoe" would be able to view a page.
In a more serious example, it could mean that employees at a company can only access a system within a specified time window.

ABAC is much more fine-grained than RBAC, but it's a lot more flexible in my opinion.
ABAC allows the application to have permissions defined around things outside of the user's identity.
I think, technically, ABAC can use a "role" property for its definitions; however, that just sounds like RBAC with extra steps.
In terms of implementations, I have not worked with a system that uses ABAC previously so I can't comment much on this.
I imagine the logic for finding valid attributes would be more complicated than the technique used for RBAC.

# Conclusion

It's really important to consider access control within a software application at scale.
There is no "one size fits all" solution for systems, so a project could use either ABAC or RBAC.
In fact, a great solution would be a mix of both systems! Be warned though, this would be a larger undertaking
than just implementing one or the other. It may also turn out to be worse than just choosing one!

In the end, as long as an application has access control at all is a step in the right direction.
Nobody wants to be a liability for leaking sensitive information out, or putting people in harm's way
through their lack of care. Security and quality code should be top of mind for any project.
