# Introduction

I'm personally a fan of [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/). I think they're both great frameworks and love seeing them grow.
One thing Astro is missing is a SPA router, although they are working on developing one.
Remix, on the other hand, is built on the foundation of the React Router.
Remix not only has the React Router, but they also are developing [routers](https://github.com/brophdawg11/remix-routers) in Vue, Svelte, and other libraries.
I think it would be great to see Remix routers work with Astro. Let's take a look at how we can do that.

# What is Astro?

Explain what Astro is and why you chose to use it for your project.
 Discuss how other SSR frameworks like Solid Start and Tanstack are planning to use Astro as their base.

# Setting up the Remix router with Astro

Getting started with the Remix routers is fairly straightforward.
Once you have your preferred router installed, you can instantly start using it in your Astro project.
The caveat is that these router components can only be loaded on the client.
You will have to specify **client:only** on the Island in Astro.

Here's an example of the Remix router working with Vue:

Here's an example of the Remix router working with Astro:

# Limitations of using multiple routers

Discuss the limitations of using multiple routers in a project
and how they can affect communication between different parts of the application.
Explain how this compares to something like React Query.

Although I was able to get the routers working in Astro, they aren't connected.
This isn't a huge deal for me since I just wanted to see how these packages worked.
There might be a way to get them to interact with one another, but I hadn't looked into it.
This would require the Link components from the routers to push history to each other.
Again, it might be doable, but I haven't looked into it.
It is weird to see one router be at one url and the other routers to show data from old urls.

# Conclusion

Implementing the Remix routers in Astro was fairly straightforward.
I think it would be great to see Astro support these routers out of the box, in some capacity.
I'm not sure how that would work, but I think it would be a great addition to the Astro ecosystem.
I am interested in what it'd be like to run Remix directly off Astro.
Astro already has a strong foundation for SSR, so building Remix with Vue or Svelte off of this would be great.
