## Pass 1: General Idea

- Title: Noria: dynamic, partially-stateful data-flow for high-performance web applications
- Abstract: Noria is a partially-stateful backend that aims to solve the issue of persistent up-to-date views in a relational database.
    It achieves many of its goals while reducing memory usage, and increasing performance of reads and writes on a MySQL database.
- Introduction: The Noria paper addresses one of the biggest concerns that users face with web applications: latency.
    Dynamic web applications typically retrieve data from a database, commonly a relational SQL database. This database must return data
    in a timely manner so as not to disrupt the user experience. Another issue users face with web applications is stale data.
    There are other implementations of how to fetch dynamic up-to-date data from a database; however, Noria proposes a new method that
    claims to have multiple advantages over current solutions: differential dataflow, materialized views, and incremental view maintenance.

### Conclusions
Noria is a rust-based web application backend designed for low-latency with eentual consistency.
Some of its achievements are only possible due to partial-state data-flow. This provides Noria a reduced memory footprint,
with fast reads and writes. There is more work to be done and Noria does not support all current SQL keywords.

#### Five Cs

1. Category: This is a description of a research prototype. Noria an existing Rust project from a PhD thesis.
2. Context: This paper is related to databases, latency, and eventual consistency.
3. Correctness: This paper makes claims that are backed up through the existing Rust project.
    The reliability of these claims is reinforced by the fact that Planetscale uses it as the foundation for their _Boost_ feature.
4. Contributions: The Noria project as well as the partial-state data-flow concepts.
5. Clarity: I would say this paper is very well-written.

## Pass 2: Grasp Content

One of the things that Noria does differently than typical caching is that it just doesn't cache.
There still exists persistent storage, but it does not involve cache invalidation in the typical fashion.
It reads incrementally for its views. It doesn't use natural SQL queries for its reads, and it is able to
keep data across a long undetermined amount of time unlike other "previous week"-type queries.
This is what makes Noria distinct from natural queries, key-value caches like Redis, and streamed "windowed" queries.
You get the best of windowed queries and key-value caches without downtime.

>Noriaâ€™s current design primarily targets relational operators,
rather than the iterative or graph computations that are
the focus of other data-flow systems

Noria can be run on a server and uses _base_ tables and _derived_ tables. The base tables are stored on disk
persistently while the derived tables are stored in memory on the server.
Noria requires sufficient memory to maintain the views, but it will evict infrequently-accessed data.

Noria programs look like plain SQL, but they actually use an internal syntax to allow for internal and external views.
They do have a MySQL/MariaDB though that it mentioned in the paper.

Noria's data-flow uses a directed acyclic graph(DAG) that consists of joins, filters, and aggregations across base tables and views.
Noria depends on deterministic data. Non-deterministic functions like `NOW()` or `RAND()` make it difficult to persist data across the views.

Personally, this is one of the most fasctinating parts of the Noria database. The ability to create the query as a DAG sounds intuitive.
It reminds me of C#'s LINQ which forms the query through an abstract syntax tree. Obviously, LINQ doesn't perform the upquerying or live
changes that Noria does however that's one similar I see.
